# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissor game assignment from The Odin Project


For this assignment I'm going to be programming my first simple game using Javascript! A simple Rock Paper Scissors game. Sounds simple but I'm still wet behing the ears. 

I will report back when I'm done.

Calling this one finished for now. That was a lot of fun!
I had lots of fu figuring out how to make it all work. 
I used google when I was stuck and figured out some errors by myself.
I'll likely revisit and clean up the code a but when we build a GUI for it.
