# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissor game assignment from The Odin Project


For this assignment I'm going to be programming my first simple game using Javascript! A simple Rock Paper Scissors game. Sounds simple but I'm still wet behing the ears. 

I will report back when I'm done.

Calling this one finished for now. That was a lot of fun!

I used google when I was stuck and figured out some errors by myself.
I'll likely revisit and clean up the code a but when we build a GUI for it.

Testing pushing and working on a new branch with git and github.

Refactor mostly complete. Game now has a visual UI that functions properly. The game can be reset and once a winner is declared the game resets automatically as soon as you press any button. The code is a bit messy and I'm sure there are cleaner and better ways to do this but it's a learning experience. The CSS could use a little cleanup as well to fix redundancy. 

Gonna call this done for now. Little cleanups and UI spruce ups might happen but I think I got what I was suppossed too with this project. 

Next step is to merge with main on Github and move to the next project on TOP.
